            <p><strong>Ralph J. Coates, PhD</strong></p>

            <p>Dr. Coates is the Associate Director for Science in the Office of Public Health Genomics (OPHG) at the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. He serves as a lead scientist for OPHG in promoting the evidence-based translation of genomics into public health and is the lead of the Knowledge Synthesis program. Major activities of the Knowledge Synthesis program include support of the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) initiative, which conducts systematic evidence reviews to evaluate the validity and utility of genetic/genomic services in transition from research to practice, and two Web resources for evidence on the validity and utility of genomic services: the Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Knowledge Base and the publication Evidence on Genomic Tests. Dr. Coates received his AB from Harvard in 1971 and completed his PhD in epidemiology in 1986 at the University of Washington while working at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. From 1987 through 1995, he was a faculty member at Emory University, where he conducted epidemiologic research in cancer and in nutrition, taught in the School of Public Health and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, became a tenured Associate Professor in Epidemiology, and was Co-Director of the Nutrition and Health Sciences Program. He is now an Adjunct Professor in Epidemiology. He joined CDC?s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control in 1995 where he did public health research and program activities in cancer prevention, primarily in evaluating the utility of cancer screening tests and the effectiveness of community interventions to increase delivery of recommended screening services. He became the Division?s Associate Director for Science in 2000.  In 2007, he joined OPHG as the Associate Director for Science. He is an author or co-author more than 130 peer-reviewed journal articles and 40 other publications. He is currently participating in the U.S. Institute of Medicine?s Roundtable on Translating Genomics Research for Health and was previously a member of the IOM?s National Cancer Policy Forum.  He has served on committees and work groups for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the U.S. President's Cancer Panel, and the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative.</p></td>
