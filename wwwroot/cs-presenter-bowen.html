            <p><strong>Deborah Bowen, Ph.D.</strong></p>

            <p>Dr. Bowen is a Full Professor and Chair in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences of the School of Public Health at Boston University.  Dr. Bowen is currently an investigator in the regional Cancer Prevention Network, focused on community based research on cancer prevention targets.   She is a co-investigator on the regional Native American Community Health Network, a group of investigators and community health experts working to conduct research and training in Native communities in the West.  Dr. Bowen is the principal investigator on a Melanoma prevention study, which adapts a cancer-related behavior change intervention for delivery via the Internet to at risk families. She has been the principal investigator of several NIH-funded grants involving breast and ovarian cancer risk feedback and communications, including the Breast Cancer Risk Counseling Studies, the RISK study and the WIRES study.  Dr. Bowen has been an investigator in the coordinating centers of three large multi-center prevention trials: the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), the Women's Health Trial: Feasibility Study in Minority Populations (WHT:FSMP) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).  She is currently conducting community based research to improve the health of Native people in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, in collaboration with the Cancer Information Service.  In addition, Dr. Bowen has led or participated in numerous community intervention studies that have successfully recruited and maintained advisory committees, including members of the community representing the target audience.  She was a co-investigator and member of the Steering committee for a large R25T training grant for pre and post doctoral fellows at the University of Washington, focused on health communications and biobehavioral cancer prevention.  She was the principal investigator for a church-based dietary intervention trial and in that role chaired an advisory committee of local church leaders representing a broad variety of denominations. </p></td>
