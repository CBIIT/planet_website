            <p>The Cancer Control PLANET web portal is a collaborative effort aimed at providing access to data and resources 
that can help cancer control planners, health educators, program staff, and researchers  design, implement and evaluate 
evidence-based cancer control programs.  The PLANET is intended to help planners, program staff and 
researchers achieve their shared goals:
<ul>
	<li>Reduce cancer incidence</li>
	<li>Reduce the number of deaths from cancer</li>
	<li>Enhance quality of life for cancer survivors</li>
</ul>
