Bradford W. Hesse, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p>Bradford (Brad) Hesse  was appointed Chief of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Health  Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) in November 2006. He  served as the Acting Chief of HCIRB from 2004&#8211;2006. </p>
<p>  Dr. Hesse's professional focus lies in bringing  the power of health communication technologies to bear on the problem of  eliminating death and suffering from cancer, a cause to which he remains  steadfastly dedicated. While at the NCI, he has championed several initiatives  that evaluate and progress the science of cancer communication and informatics,  two of which include the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and  the Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communication (CECCR).</p>
<p>  Prior to his work at the National Cancer  Institute, Dr. Hesse conducted research in the interdisciplinary fields of  human computer interaction, health communication, medical informatics, and  computer-supported decision making. In 1988, he served as a postdoctoral member  of the Committee for Social Science Research on Computing at Carnegie Mellon  University, and subsequently  co-founded the Center for Research on Technology at the American Institutes for  Research in Palo Alto, California in 1991. Working in a contract  environment before coming to NCI, Dr. Hesse directed projects for the  Departments of Education and Labor, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. He has also provided  usability services to Apple Computer, Hewlett Packard, Xerox, Microsoft, Sun,  and Netscape.</p>
<p>  Dr. Hesse currently serves on the board of  advisors for the American Psychological Association's online resource,  PsycINFO, and is a member of the American Psychological Society, the  Association for Computing Machineries, Special Interest Group on Human Computer  Interaction (SIG-CHI), the American Medical Informatics Association, the  International Communication Association, and the Usability Professionals  Association.</p></td>
