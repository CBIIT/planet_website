            <p><strong>Michael C. Fiore,  M.D., M.P.H., M.B.A.</strong></p>

            <p>Michael Fiore, professor of  medicine, founded and has served as Director of the University of Wisconsin  Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI) since it was established  in 1992. He is a clinically active  general internist and preventive medicine specialist, treating patients for  tobacco dependence.</p>
            <p>Dr. Fiore is a nationally recognized  expert on tobacco, providing perspectives to audiences ranging from <em>Good Morning America</em> to the United  States Senate. He has written numerous  articles, chapters, and books on cigarette smoking and was a consulting editor  of <em>Reducing Tobacco Use&mdash;A Report of the  Surgeon General </em>(2000). <br><br>
              Fiore served as chair of the panel  that produced the United States Public Health Service (PHS) Clinical Practice  Guideline: <em>Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence</em>, in 2000 which provides a  gold standard for healthcare providers.&nbsp;That PHS Guideline was updated and published in 2008 with the  simultaneous endorsement of 58 leading medical and public health  organizations. He co-directed The Robert  Wood Johnson Foundation National Program Offices, <em>Addressing Tobacco in Managed Care </em>and <em>Addressing Tobacco in  Healthcare Research Network</em>.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              Dr. Fiore chaired the U.S. Department  of Health and Human Services Subcommittee on Tobacco Cessation of the  Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health that produced a comprehensive plan  for promoting tobacco cessation in the United States.In July 2003, he was one of five national recipients of the  Innovators in Combating Substance Abuse Award from the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation. In 2005, Dr. Fiore was asked  by the United States Justice Department as part of their landmark lawsuit  against the tobacco industry to craft a $130 billion, 25-year plan to assist 33  million smokers to quit.<br>
  <br>
              Fiore&rsquo;s chief research and policy  focus has been to develop strategies to prompt clinicians and health care  systems to intervene with patients who use tobacco. As part of this effort, he spearheaded the  concept of expanding the vital signs to include tobacco use status.&nbsp; Recent research shows that 70 percent of  physicians now ask patients about their smoking status.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              Starting in 1999, Dr. Fiore was  principal investigator for a 5-year NIH-funded Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use  Research Center (TTURC) grant designed to understand tobacco dependence in  order to prevent relapse to smoking. In  September, 2004, he began his role as co-principal investigator of a second  TTURC grant, seeking to examine tobacco dependence treatment and outcomes with  an eye to determining the effectiveness of various treatments and matching  those treatments to smokers wishing to quit.  In September 2009, he began serving as principal investigator for the  third NIH/NCI P50 grant awarded to  UW-CTRI, <em>Engineering Effective Interventions  for Tobacco Use: A Translational Laboratory.</em></p>
            <p>After graduating from Bowdoin College,  Dr. Fiore completed medical school at Northwestern  University in Chicago  and his internal medicine training at Boston City   Hospital. His postgraduate education included a Master  of Public Health from Harvard   University. Dr. Fiore received additional training as an  Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Officer for the United States Centers for  Disease Control where he also completed a Preventive Medicine residency program  at the United States Office on Smoking and Health before coming to the  University of Wisconsin-Madison. In  2009, Dr. Fiore earned an M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin School of  Business.</p></td>
