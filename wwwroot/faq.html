					There are several ways that you can help promote Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. A Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. information fact sheet can be downloaded from our website and is intended for those involved in planning and developing programs (not for those who do cancer screenings).<!-- If you are interested in conducting a training or being trained on Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T., please contact the NCI Cancer Information Service individual within your state or territory. They are listed under Program Partners within Step 2 of the Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. web portal.--><br /><br />
					Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. give-away items (e.g. pens, sticky notes, etc.) are also available and can be provided to individuals who conduct trainings or host conference booths to promote the Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. website. If interested, please e-mail us using the "<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>" link and include the following information below.<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li>Name of the event you are requesting the promotional items</li>
						<li>Date(s) of the event</li>
						<li>Purpose of the event</li>
						<li>Number of people anticipated attending the event</li>
						<li>Address to mail the items (include who they should be sent to)</li>
					</ul>
					There is no fee associated with using these promotion items, but please note that due to limited availability, the items are reserved for individuals promoting the P.L.A.N.E.T. at a training, presentation or exhibit.

					Cancer control planners, program staff, and researchers have the same goals: to reduce cancer risk, the number of new cancer cases, and the number of deaths from cancer, as well as enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors. While many share the same goals, all do not have easy access to resources that can facilitate the transfer of evidence-based research findings into practice. This Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. portal provides access to data and resources that can help planners, program staff, and researchers to design, implement and evaluate evidence-based cancer control programs.<br /><br />
					The Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. portal provides access to Web-based resources that can assist in:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Assessing the cancer and/or risk factor burden within a given state.</li>
						<li>Identifying potential partner organizations that may already be working with high-risk populations.</li>
						<li>Understanding current research findings and recommendations.</li>
						<li>Accessing and downloading evidence-based programs and products.</li>
						<li>Finding guidelines for planning and evaluation.</li>
